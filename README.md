My Dotfiles
===========

My dotfiles are kept in ~/.dotfiles/ for better organisation and source code
management.

The following files and directories need to be aliased to the home folder in
order to work:

    - ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bashrc  ~/.bashrc
    - ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/  ~/.vim/
    - ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vimrc  ~/.vimrc
    - ln -s ~/.dotfiles/gvimrc  ~/.gvimrc
